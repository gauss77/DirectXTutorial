# D3D12 Raytracing Samples
This collection of samples act as an introduction to DirectX Raytracing (DXR). The samples are divided into tutorials and advanced samples. Each tutorial sample introduces a few new DXR concepts. Advanced samples demonstrate more complex techniques and applications of raytracing. We will be adding more samples in the coming future, so check back. In addition, you can find more DXR samples tutorials at [Nvidia's DXR samples Github](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/DxrTutorials).

The samples are implemented using both DXR and D3D12 Raytracing Fallback Layer APIs. This is purely for demonstration purposes to show API differences. Real-world applications will implement only one or the other. The Fallback Layer uses DXR if a driver and OS supports it. Otherwise, it falls back to the compute pipeline to emulate raytracing.

### Getting Started
* DXR spec/documentation is available in the SDK package at [Getting Started with Raytracing](http://forums.directxtech.com/index.php?topic=5860.0) post.
* [Raytracing Fallback Layer documentation](../../../Libraries/D3D12RaytracingFallback/readme.md).

# Tutorial Samples
## 1. [Hello World Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingHelloWorld/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates how to setup a raytracing pipeline and render a triangle in screen space.

## 2. [Simple Lighting Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingSimpleLighting/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates how to do ray generation for a dynamic perspective camera and calculate simple diffuse shading for a cube from a dynamic point light.

## 3. [Procedural Geometry Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingProceduralGeometry/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates how to implement procedural geometry using intersection shaders and shows usage of more complex shader table layouts and multiple ray types.

## 4. [Library Subobjects Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingLibrarySubobjects/readme.md)
This sample modifies the Simple Lighting sample, and illustrates how to use library subobjects.

# Advanced Samples

## [MiniEngine Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingMiniEngineSample/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates integration of the Fallback Layer in the MiniEngine's Model Viewer and several sample uses of raytracing.
